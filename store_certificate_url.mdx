When a form is submitted, the **Consent Certificate URL** is automatically passed in the form submission request under the `FormcertifyUrl` parameter. This URL acts as a unique, tamper-proof link to the certificate that stores all evidence of consent.

## Why Save the Certificate URL?

* **Proof of Compliance**: The Certificate URL provides a verifiable record of consent, meeting legal and regulatory requirements.

* **Easy Sharing**: Share the URL with partners, auditors, or third parties to validate consent without exposing sensitive data.

* **Secure Access**: The URL is independently managed and stored, ensuring its integrity and authenticity.

## How to Use the Certificate URL

1. **Capture the URL**: Retrieve the `FormcertifyUrl` parameter from the form submission payload.

2. **Store it Securely**: Save the URL in your database alongside the form submission data for future reference.

3. **Provide on Request**: Share the URL with third parties when they need to validate the consent.

By storing the Certificate URL, you ensure that all parties have access to an independent source of truth for consent verification.
