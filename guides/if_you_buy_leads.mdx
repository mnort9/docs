1. Make sure you're receiving a certificate URL with a lead from the lead generation company (originator)

2. When a lead is received, validate your company was granted one-to-one consent by using the Validate API

3. If the validation outcome is "Yes", use the Vault API to retain the certificate for 5 years

4. Store the Certificate URL for that contact in your database or CRM
