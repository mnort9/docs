Certificates can be vaulted in two ways:

## 1. Auto-Vault (Recommended)

Vault certificates automatically when a form sumbission is received. This ensures every consent certificate is retained successfully. 

To enable Auto-Vault:
1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Enable the "Auto-Vault" option

## 2. Manually Vault via API

In some cases you may only want to Vault specific certificates. 

Use your certificate URL to make a request to the **Vault API**. See [Vault API Reference](api-reference/certificate/vault).
