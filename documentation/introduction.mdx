Welcome to the official Formcertify documentation. This guide will help you integrate, implement, and use Formcertify to securely issue, vault, and validate consent certificates.

## What is Formcertify?

By generating tamper-proof certificates, Formcertify ensures you have irrefutable proof of consent for audits, legal disputes, or third-party validation.
